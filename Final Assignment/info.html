        <h2>A little bit about... History!</h2>
        <p>
          Canada was first discovered by europeans as they found that all the land was populated by
          natives. They also called those natives indians because the very first people to reach
          Canada thought they were at the East Indies. All the native people survived 100% from
          everything that was provided in those unknown lands. The arrival of Europeans affect the
          way of living of the natives in the area. The land was most colonized by british and
          French people which affected the official language of Canada nowadays. As years pass by
          and the process of colonization starts, british and french went on a head on conflict with
          each other and the British ended up victorious being responsible for most of the
          colonization which today resulted in Canada.

            It's one of the most natural attractions that you can find in Canada! Basically the
            falls are one of the most giant Waterfalls and this attraction of a lot of tourists

          <li>Banff National Park & the Rocky Mountains</li>
          <p>
            Like I've mentioned before Canada has a lot of natural attractions due to it's vast
            land. The park is in between mountains, as people say, the heart of the mountain! one of
            the most beautiful places that you can ever imagine.

        <h2>A little bit about... Travel tips!</h2>
        <p>
          If you love winter, then I recommend coming in the winter season if you don't I would
          recommend coming in the summer. Why that? because most attractions are completely closed
          in winter due to the unexpected weather which makes any schedule unpredictable. My travel
          tip is top always plan ahead since Canada has so many provinces and so many places to be,
          the first tip is to rent a car because most busses take forever here although you can get
          a presto card and do most trips for a reasonable price you will end up wasting a lot of
          time. If you're going to rent an apartment, rent one with a kitchen so you can cook,
          buying take out or going out to eat cost a lot of money around here. Always bring a change
          of clothes with you! sometimes even in summer it can get super cold because of the rain.

      <h2>About me:</h2>

      <h3>Welcome to <em>Ana Tirolli's</em> homepage</h3>

      <br />
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Ana. I come from a mixed family of immigrants so although I was born in Brazil,
        my heritage is very mixed and very confusing to explain. I speak portuguese and english
        fluently, when I was young I used to speak Italian but as time passed by my mind forgot most
        of it. The language I'm learning at the moment is French. As my mother always said:
        <q>Do what you love</q>
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Why I chose this destination:</h3>
      <p>
        Since I was a child, I had a huge interest in Canada. One of the motives being the fact that
        I've never seen snow in my entire life since in my country It's never that cold. So for me
        Canada was always a wonderland, I went there my first time as an exchange student in 2015.
        Firstly, I went to vancouver as a teenager with average english skills. Canada gave me the
        freedom that I never had in my country. I could walk alone at night, walking alone wasn't
        scary as a woman and everything I ever imagined, although I may find those things in other
        places as well, my mind was set on Canada. Citizens are very welcoming and there is a huge
        variety of cultures living together, making the experience more spectacular
      </p>
